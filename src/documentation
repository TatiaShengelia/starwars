You run the app like a normal react app (in terminal write "npm start"). After that you get a list of characters with search bar on top and pagitation below. You write in the search bar to search for whichever character you want to. Below, when you press "next", you go to next page and when you press "previous", you go to the previous page. When you press each character name, you go to the page of its detailed information. You have 5 buttons on the page: "show films", "show species", "show starships", "show vehicles", "back to list". First 4 buttons give you the detailed information about what the button tells you. After you press it, "show" gets replaced by "hide" and you can hide the detailed information by perssing it. By pressing back to list, you go back to the page with the list of character.
